Prolonged immobility or improper posture\noften leads to discomfort, musculoskeletal strain, and pressure-induced complications such\nas bedsores. Conventional monitoring methods depend largely on caregiver observation,\nwhich may result in delays and inconsistent tracking. To address this challenge, the\nproposed project introduces a smart bedsheet system designed to continuously monitor and\nimprove patient posture. The system integrates Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) sensors to\nmeasure pressure distribution at 16 points in real time. The data is processed using an\nArduino Uno board with a multiplexer, enabling accurate assessment of sitting or lying time\n", "and posture. Real-time feedback is provided through multiple interfaces: an OLED display\nwith buzzer alerts patients to prolonged immobility, while a red LED with buzzer signals\nimproper posture, thereby alerting caregivers. A green LED indicator confirms balanced\nposture, and a reset switch allows for easy identification and restart of monitoring when\nrequired. This design offers a non-invasive, low-cost, and portable solution for patient\nposture management. By providing continuous monitoring and timely alerts, the system\nhelps prevent pressure ulcers, enhances patient comfort, and reduces caregiver burden.\nBeyond hospitals, it has potential applications in rehabilitation centers and home healthcare,\nmaking it a versatile tool for proactive patient management. In conclusion, the smart\nbed", "sheet system bridges the gap between patient comfort and clinical intervention,\ncontributing to safer and more effective healthcare for vulnerable individuals.\n5"], "5": ["TABLE OF CONTENTS\nCONTENT PAGE\n#\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT iv\nABSTRACT v\nLIST OF TABLES viii\nLIST OF FIGURES ix\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS x\nCHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 1\n1.1 Error!

Prolonged pressure on specific body regions can\nlead to pressure ulcers (bedsores), musculoskeletal strain, and severe discomfort. According\nto the World Health Organization, pressure ulcers affect millions of patients worldwide,\nwith an estimated prevalence of 8–25% among hospitalized individuals. These ulcers not\nonly prolong hospital stays but also increase the risk of infections, pain, and mortality.\nTraditional monitoring methods rely on manual observation by caregivers, which can be\ninconsistent and delayed. To overcome these limitations, smart healthcare technologies\nusing pressure sensors and micro", "controllers have emerged for continuous and accurate\nmonitoring.\nThis project introduces a Smart Bedsheet System that uses Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR)\nsensors and Arduino Uno to monitor pressure distribution and detect patient posture in real\ntime. The system provides alerts through LEDs, a buzzer, and an OLED display to warn\nabout prolonged immobility or improper posture.\nThe motivation behind this project is to develop a low-cost, non-invasive, and portable\nsolution that enhances patient comfort, prevents pressure ulcers, and reduces caregiver\nworkload. It has wide applications in hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and home healthcare.\n1.2 Problem Statement\nPatients who are bedridden or paralyzed are at high risk of developing pressure ulcers and\nmusculoskeletal discomfort due to prol", "onged immobility and improper posture. Traditional\nposture monitoring methods rely mainly on manual observation by caregivers, which is\ntime-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error. Existing technologies for pressure\nand posture monitoring are often expensive, complex, or non-portable, making them\nunsuitable for widespread use in hospitals and home healthcare settings. Therefore, there is\na need for a reliable, real-time, and low-cost system capable of continuously monitoring a\npatient’s posture and pressure distribution. Such a system should provide immediate alerts\nto prevent complications, improve comfort, and assist caregivers in timely intervention. The\nproposed Smart Bedsheet System addresses this gap by integrating Force Sensitive Resistor\n(FSR) sensors, Arduino Uno, and a", "lert mechanisms to enable efficient and continuous\nposture monitoring.\n1.3 Objectives and Outcomes\nThe primary objective of this project is to design and implement a Smart Bedsheet System\ncapable of continuously monitoring patient posture and pressure distribution to prevent\ndiscomfort and pressure ulcers. The system aims to provide real-time alerts through an\nOLED display, buzzer, and LED indicators when improper posture or prolonged immobility\n1"], "11": ["is detected. Using Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) sensors integrated at multiple pressure\npoints and processed through an ESP32, the system accurately identifies sitting or lying\npostures and alerts caregivers when intervention is needed. The project also focuses on\ncreating a low-cost, non-invasive, and portable solution suitable for hospitals, rehabilitation\ncenters, and home healthcare environments. The expected outcomes include a fully\nfunctional prototype capable of detecting posture and immobility in real time, improving\ncaregiver efficiency, and reducing the risk of pressure ulcers by enabling timely corrective\nactions and enhancing overall patient comfort.\n1.4 Scope and Applications\nThe scope of this project includes the design and development of a Smart Bedsheet System\ncapable of ", "detecting and monitoring patient posture and pressure distribution using Force\nSensitive Resistor (FSR) sensors. The data collected from 16 pressure points is processed\nthrough an ESP32 with a multiplexer, and the system provides real-time alerts via an OLED\ndisplay, buzzer, and LED indicators. The project focuses on the detection of sitting, lying,\nand immobile postures, along with alerts for improper posture or prolonged immobility. The\nscope does not include wireless data transmission, cloud-based monitoring, or advanced\nimage-based posture detection, as the emphasis is on creating a low-cost and portable\nhardware-based prototype.\nThis system has broad applications in hospitals, rehabilitation centers, elderly care facilities,\nand home healthcare. It can assist caregivers in continuousl", "y monitoring bedridden or\nparalyzed patients, reduce the risk of pressure ulcers, and improve patient comfort and\nsafety. Furthermore, the design can be extended in the future to include IoT connectivity,\nmobile app integration, and data analytics for remote monitoring and medical record\ntracking.\n2"], "12": ["CHAPTER 2 RELATED WORK AND NEED FOR THE\nPROJECT\n2.1 Existing Research, Technologies or Products\n● Research literature: Several studies have been conducted to develop smart\nhealthcare solutions for posture and pressure monitoring, focusing on patient safety,\ncomfort, and ulcer prevention. Researchers have explored the use of pressure\nmapping systems, wearable sensors, and IoT-based monitoring devices to analyze\npressure distribution and detect postural changes.\nFor instance, Kim et al. developed a flexible pressure sensor array using\npiezoresistive materials to monitor patient posture and predict pressure ulcer risk.\nTheir study demonstrated that continuous pressure monitoring could reduce ulcer\nincidence by over 40%. Similarly, Kumar and Singh proposed an IoT-enabled bed\nmonitoring system ", "that utilized pressure sensors connected to a microcontroller for\nreal-time posture detection and alerting. Another study by Patel et al. [3] reviewed\nwearable and non-wearable sensing systems in rehabilitation and healthcare,\nemphasizing the growing importance of non-invasive, low-cost solutions for\ncontinuous monitoring.\nHowever, most existing systems either rely on complex sensor arrays, costly data\nacquisition units, or require cloud integration, which limits their accessibility in low-\nresource healthcare environments. This creates a research gap for affordable,\ncompact, and efficient posture monitoring systems that can be easily deployed in\nhospitals and homes.\n● Existing technologies or commercial products: Several commercial products exist\nin the healthcare market for pressure ulce", "r prevention and posture detection, yet they\nare often expensive and limited in customization. For example, the XSENSOR\nPressure Mapping System offers high-resolution pressure data and visualization for\nclinical applications but comes at a high cost and requires professional setup. The\nLeaf Patient Monitoring System uses wearable sensors to track patient movement\nand position changes, transmitting data wirelessly to a monitoring hub. Although\neffective, its dependence on wireless connectivity and power sources increases\noperational complexity.\nAnother product, the Sensit Smart Bed System, integrates pressure sensors within\nhospital mattresses to detect patient movement and provide alerts. However, such\ncommercial beds are expensive and not feasible for small healthcare centers or home\nuse.", " These systems demonstrate the effectiveness of pressure-based monitoring but\nhighlight the lack of low-cost, standalone solutions that provide real-time alerts\nwithout external infrastructure.\n● Relevant patents: Several patents have been filed in the field of smart beds and\npressure monitoring systems. For instance, U.S. Patent US20180134567A1\n3"], "13": ["describes a smart bed with embedded pressure sensors for posture detection and\nautomatic adjustment of mattress support. Another patent, US20190234511A1,\nfocuses on a wireless posture monitoring device using distributed sensors to prevent\nulcers. These patented systems highlight the industry’s focus on automated comfort\nand pressure management. However, many rely on complex actuators or cloud\nsystems, leaving room for innovation in simpler, affordable, and portable hardware-\nbased monitoring solutions like the proposed smart bedsheet.\n2.2 Gaps and Challenges in Existing Approaches\nAlthough existing research and commercial products have advanced patient posture\nmonitoring, several gaps and challenges remain. Most commercial solutions, such as high-\nresolution pressure mapping systems and sm", "art hospital beds, are expensive, non-portable,\nand require specialized installation, limiting accessibility in small healthcare centers and\nhome environments. Wearable or wireless sensor-based systems, while effective, depend on\ncontinuous power supply, wireless connectivity, and frequent maintenance, which can\ncompromise reliability in real-world condition. From a research perspective, many proposed\nsystems are prototype-level with limited testing on actual patients, resulting in unclear\naccuracy and scalability. Furthermore, most existing systems focus on data collection and\nvisualization but lack real-time, actionable alerts for improper posture or prolonged\nimmobility. There is also limited integration of low-cost, non-invasive, and portable designs\nthat can be widely deployed in hosp", "itals, rehabilitation centers, or home care. These gaps\nhighlight the need for a simple, reliable, and affordable system that provides continuous\nreal-time posture monitoring, timely alerts to both patients and caregivers, and a portable\ndesign suitable for diverse healthcare settings. The proposed Smart Bedsheet System\naddresses these challenges by combining FSR-based sensing, Arduino processing, and local\nalert mechanisms in a low-cost, user-friendly solution.\n2.3 Need for the Proposed Project\nThe prevalence of pressure ulcers and posture-related complications among bedridden or\nparalyzed patients highlights a critical need for continuous and reliable posture monitoring.\nExisting methods, including manual caregiver observation or commercial smart beds, are\noften time-consuming, expensive", ", and inaccessible for widespread use, especially in home\nhealthcare or small medical facilities. Wearable or wireless sensor systems, while\npromising, face challenges such as dependence on continuous power, connectivity issues,\nand high maintenance requirements. These limitations result in delayed detection of\nimproper posture or prolonged immobility, increasing the risk of pressure ulcers,\nmusculoskeletal discomfort, and caregiver burden. Studies indicate that early and\ncontinuous posture monitoring can reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers by up to 40% ,\nyet current solutions do not adequately provide low-cost, portable, and real-time monitoring\nsuitable for diverse healthcare settings.\nTherefore, there is a pressing need for a simple, affordable, and non-invasive system that\nenables ", "continuous posture assessment and timely alerts to patients and caregivers. The\nproposed Smart Bedsheet System addresses this gap by offering real-time pressure and\nposture monitoring without reliance on complex infrastructure, thereby improving patient\ncomfort, safety, and proactive healthcare management.\n4"], "14": ["CHAPTER 3 REQUIREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS\n3.1 Requirements\n3.1.1 Functional Requirements\nThe PressuCare Smart Bedsheet System is designed to monitor patient posture and\nimmobility in real time.

It highlights the technical achievements, ethical and professional\nresponsibilities, societal and environmental impacts, and sustainability considerations. The\nlimitations of the current work are acknowledged, and recommendations for future\nimprovements are provided. Finally, the chapter concludes with a summary of how the\nproject meets its stated objectives and contributes to engineering practice.\n6.1 Technical Achievements and Trade-offs\nThe development of the smart bedsheet system resulted in successful integration of\nembedded hardware, sensing technology, and software-based visualization to monitor\npatient posture and immobility in real time. The system ", "achieved its primary objective of\ndetecting pressure variations using FSR sensors and providing alerts when poor posture or\nprolonged immobility was detected. The ESP32 microcontroller successfully processed\nsensor inputs, triggered LED and buzzer alerts, and transmitted data to the backend\ninterface. The system also demonstrated the capability to generate a pressure heatmap,\nenabling caregivers to understand patient posture trends visually.\n6.2 Limitations\nWhile the prototype demonstrated successful functionality in detecting pressure variations\nand generating real-time alerts, several limitations were identified during development and\ntesting. Acknowledging these constraints provides clarity on the current system boundaries\nand helps define improvement paths for future iterations.\n• Limi", "ted Sensor Coverage:\nThe prototype used only five FSR sensors placed at key pressure points. Although sufficient\nfor proof-of-concept, this configuration may not capture fine-grained posture variations\nacross the entire body surface.\n• Calibration Variability:\nFSR sensors are sensitive to placement, fabric tension, temperature, and humidity. As a\nresult, calibration values fluctuated when the fabric stretched or shifted, potentially affecting\naccuracy during extended usage.\n• Testing Environment Constraints:\nTesting was conducted primarily in controlled lab conditions using simulated loads and\nshort-duration trials. Real-world environments involving patient movement, perspiration,\nlong immobilization periods, and bedding materials were not fully evaluated.\n• Power Consumption Exceeds Targe", "t:\nThe system’s power usage was measured at approximately 5.8 W, exceeding the planned\nupper limit of 5 W. Continuous sensor sampling and Wi-Fi transmission contributed to this\noverhead.\n33"], "43": ["• Limited Clinical Validation:\nThe system was not tested on actual bedridden patients or medical caregivers due to ethical\nand logistical constraints. As a result, user comfort, long-term reliability, and clinical\nsuitability could not be fully assessed.\n• Basic Alert Logic:\nThe current prototype uses fixed threshold-based alerts. It does not yet incorporate adaptive\nlearning or personalization based on patient weight, movement behavior, or medical\ncondition.\n• Single-User System:\nThe backend dashboard and configurations support only one patient profile at a time. Multi-\nuser scalability, patient differentiation, and cloud-level data management were beyond the\ncurrent scope.\n6.3 Ethical and Professional Responsibilities\nThroughout the development of the smart bedsheet system, ethical, safe", "ty, and professional\nobligations were taken into careful consideration to ensure that the design aligns with\nresponsible engineering practice. Because the project involves collecting health-related data\nand may eventually be used in clinical or home-care settings, standards such as the IEEE\nCode of Ethics, GDPR data protection principles, and relevant medical device safety\nexpectations were referenced during design decisions.\nData Protection, Privacy, and Software Responsibility:\nAlthough the current prototype stores data locally for testing, considerations were made for\nfuture expansion involving cloud-based logging. To align with fundamental GDPR and\nHIPAA principles, the system architecture was designed with:\n• No personally identifiable information stored in the prototype phase.\n• Loca", "l computation of readings to avoid unnecessary transmission of sensitive data.\n• Restricted access to system dashboards to prevent unauthorized use.\n• Plans to apply encryption and anonymization if remote or cloud storage is\nimplemented in future phases.\nThe software logic remains transparent, explainable, and rule-based rather than using\nopaque decision models. This ensures the system avoids algorithmic bias and maintains\ninterpretability in identifying patient risk conditions such as immobility or poor posture.\nHardware Safety and User Protection:\nSince the system is intended for long-duration contact with a patient lying on a bed, strict\nattention was paid to physical and electrical safety:\n• Low-voltage operation (<5V logic level) to avoid electrical hazards.\n• All solder joints reinfo", "rced and insulated to prevent exposure.\n• The electronics were positioned externally to avoid direct skin contact, aligning with\nbasic biocompatibility and comfort requirements.\n• No sharp edges, exposed wiring, or heating elements were present, reducing risk of\nburns, irritation, or injury.\n34"], "44": ["While the prototype is not yet certified as a medical device, its design considerations align\nwith foundational elements of ISO 13485 (Medical Device Quality Management) and IEC\n60601-1 (Electrical Safety for Medical Equipment).\nResponsibility to Users and Stakeholders:\nA major professional consideration was ensuring that the system supports, rather than\nreplaces, caregiver judgment. Alerts are assistive, not prescriptive. This aligns with ethical\nprinciples requiring that autonomous systems remain accountable and do not create false\nassurance or overdependence.\nClear documentation and warnings accompany the prototype, stating:\n• The system is a supporting tool and not a clinical replacement.\n• Errors or delays in detection remain possible and require caregiver supervision.\nEthical Awarene", "ss and Reflection:\nBy integrating user safety, respect for privacy, transparent system functionality, and\nresponsible handling of emerging medical-grade data, the project demonstrates professional\nawareness beyond technical development. Ethical reflection guided both design constraints\nand testing procedures, ensuring that the prototype remains aligned with responsible\nengineering principles and future regulatory expectations.\n6.4 Societal, Environmental and Safety Impacts\nThe proposed smart bedsheet system has the potential to create meaningful positive impact\nacross healthcare, society, and assisted-living environments. By enabling automated\nmonitoring of posture and immobility, the system supports early prediction and prevention\nof pressure ulcers, which are a significant concern for be", "dridden patients, elderly\nindividuals, and those with limited mobility. This can contribute to improved healthcare\noutcomes, reduced caregiver burden, and increased patient dignity and comfort.\nSocietal Impact:\nFrom a societal perspective, the system provides support for vulnerable populations who are\noften dependent on manual supervision. Automating monitoring may reduce the physical\nstrain on caregivers and healthcare workers, who typically reposition patients at fixed\nintervals to avoid complications. With real-time alerts and visualization, the system\nencourages proactive care instead of reactive treatment, potentially lowering hospitalization\ntime and associated medical costs. The solution also supports remote care models, aligning\nwith emerging trends in telemedicine and digital heal", "th monitoring.\nEnvironmental Impact:\nThe environmental impact of the system is relatively minimal due to its low-energy\noperation and compact hardware footprint. Components such as the ESP32 microcontroller\nand FSR sensors consume low power, making the device energy efficient during continuous\nuse. The prototype uses reusable circuit boards, modular wiring, and replaceable electronic\nelements, which can reduce long-term electronic waste. As the system evolves toward mass\nproduction, additional improvements such as recyclable housings and eco-friendly materials\nmay further reduce environmental impact.\nSafety Considerations:\n35"], "45": ["Safety was addressed at multiple levels throughout the design and implementation stages.\nElectrically, the system operates at low DC voltages well within safe limits for human\ninteraction, reducing risk of shock or short-circuit exposure. All conductive components are\ninsulated, and the sensing layer is embedded within the fabric, ensuring there is no direct\nskin contact with electronics. Data safety was also considered, especially as the system\ninvolves personal health-related monitoring. By processing data locally in the prototype\nphase and planning secure encrypted communication for future development, the design\naligns with responsible handling of sensitive health data.\n6.5 Community Relevance\nThe proposed smart bedsheet system addresses a critical healthcare challenge that affects\nbed", "ridden patients, elderly individuals, and people with limited mobility due to illness,\ndisability, or post-surgical recovery. Pressure ulcers are a preventable yet common medical\ncomplication, particularly in hospitals, assisted-living facilities, rehabilitation centers, and\nhome-care environments.
